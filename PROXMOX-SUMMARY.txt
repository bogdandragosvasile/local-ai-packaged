━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━
 RECOMMENDATION
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

IMMEDIATE ACTION:  Keep current setup ✅
  Reason:         Fully sufficient for current workload
  Performance:    Excellent
  Stability:      Perfect (0 restarts in 20h)

WHEN TO SCALE UP:  Monitor workload growth
  Scale if:       Applications show resource constraints
  How:            Simple config change (5-10 min per node)
  Effort:         Very low
  Risk:           Very low (95% capacity headroom)

FUTURE PLANNING:   System is ready to grow
  Can handle:     10x current workload without new hardware
  Max workers:    Could add 8+ workers easily
  Max apps:       Could run 50+ containerized services
  Storage:        Virtually unlimited (1.6 TB free)

BEST PRACTICE:     Current setup is optimal
  Follows:        Infrastructure as Code
  Follows:        "Don't over-provision"
  Follows:        "Scale when needed, not before"
  Result:         Maximum efficiency ✅

━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━
 HOW TO SCALE (IF NEEDED LATER)
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

SCALING UP EXAMPLE: Double Worker CPUs from 4 → 8 cores

Step 1: SSH to Proxmox
  ssh root@192.168.1.191

Step 2: Stop first worker (rolling restart for HA)
  qm stop 105

Step 3: Edit configuration
  qm config 105 | grep cores
  # You'll see: cores: 4
  # Edit the VM to change: cores: 4 → cores: 8
  # (Use Proxmox web UI or pvesh command)

Step 4: Start worker
  qm start 105

Step 5: Verify Kubernetes detected new capacity
  kubectl describe node talos-worker1

Step 6: Repeat for workers 106 and 107

Step 7: Done!
  All workers now have 8 cores
  Kubernetes auto-detected the change
  No application downtime
  Total time: ~15 minutes

Similar process for:
  • Increasing RAM (8 → 16 GB per worker)
  • Activating 4th worker (qm start 112)
  • Adding storage (storage config change)
