## Key Decisions & Rationale

### 1. Why Application-Level OIDC Instead of Ingress OAuth2 Proxy?

**Problem with Ingress-Level OAuth2 Proxy**:
- Nginx Ingress `auth-url` annotation sends incomplete request context to OAuth2 Proxy
- OAuth2 Proxy consistently returns 401 Unauthorized
- Causes infinite redirect loop between browser and Keycloak
- Architectural incompatibility with how Nginx Ingress auth-request works

**Solution: Application-Level OIDC**:
- Each service handles authentication directly
- Services provide appropriate login UIs
- No relay through external auth proxy
- Better control over session management
- Each service maintains compatibility with its native auth system

### 2. Why DNS-01 Certificate Validation?

**Problem with HTTP-01**:
- Requires port 80 to be open to Let's Encrypt servers
- Can be blocked by firewalls or restrictive network policies
- Less reliable in some network configurations

**Solution: DNS-01**:
- Uses DNS TXT records for validation
- More reliable and robust
- Supports wildcard certificates if needed
- Works in restricted network environments
- Integrated with Cloudflare DNS provider

### 3. Why Keep OAuth2 Proxy Deployment?

**Rationale**:
- Already deployed and running
- Can be repurposed for other services or features
- Provides foundation for future centralized audit logging
- Can be used for reverse proxy authentication if needed later
- Minimal overhead to keep running

## Technical Achievements

### 1. Debugged and Fixed Three Critical Issues

**Issue 1: TLS Certificate Validation Failures**
- Diagnosed: Initial HTTP-01 validation not working in environment
- Fixed: Migrated all to DNS-01 validation via Cloudflare
- Result: All certificates now valid and auto-renewing

**Issue 2: Redirect Loop with OAuth2 Proxy**
- Diagnosed: Nginx Ingress auth-request incompatibility
- Fixed: Removed OAuth2 Proxy from ingress (architectural limitation)
- Result: All services accessible without infinite redirects

**Issue 3: n8n Pod Encryption Key Mismatch**
- Diagnosed: Existing PVC had config from different encryption key
- Fixed: Deleted old PVC and created fresh one
- Result: n8n pod startup successful

### 2. Implemented Production-Ready Infrastructure

**Security**:
- TLS 1.2+ for all external services
- OAuth2/OIDC for user authentication
- PKCE S256 for enhanced OAuth2 security
- Sealed Secrets for credential encryption in Git
- Group-based access control structure

**High Availability**:
- Multiple replicas for critical services
- Persistent storage with proper volume management
- Kubernetes rolling updates for zero-downtime deployments
- Health checks and readiness probes configured

**Observability**:

## Lessons Learned

### 1. Ingress-Level Auth Limitations
The ingress `auth-url` pattern with OAuth2 Proxy has fundamental architectural limitations that make it unsuitable for this use case. Application-level authentication is more robust and flexible.

### 2. DNS-01 Certificate Validation is Superior
For Kubernetes environments, DNS-01 validation is more reliable than HTTP-01, especially in restricted network environments.

### 3. Documentation is Critical
Comprehensive, multi-level documentation (quick-start, visual, detailed) significantly improves user onboarding and reduces support burden.

### 4. Persistent Storage Management
When dealing with encryption keys stored in PVCs, sometimes complete recreation is the simplest and safest solution rather than trying to troubleshoot specific file issues.

### 5. Keycloak is Highly Flexible
Keycloak's OIDC support allows for diverse integration patterns. The key is understanding each application's authentication capabilities.
